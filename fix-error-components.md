# Fixed Missing Error Components

## Issue
The application was showing "missing required error components, refreshing..." errors throughout the site.

## Solution
Created the required Next.js error boundary components:

1. **Root Error Component** (`/src/app/error.tsx`)
   - Handles errors at the root level
   - Provides "Try again" and "Go to homepage" options
   - Styled with luxury theme colors

2. **Global Error Component** (`/src/app/global-error.tsx`)
   - Handles critical application-wide errors
   - Uses inline styles for reliability
   - Minimal dependencies to avoid cascading failures

3. **Admin Error Component** (`/src/app/admin/error.tsx`)
   - Specific error handling for admin panel
   - Links back to admin dashboard
   - Logs admin-specific errors

4. **Account Error Component** (`/src/app/account/error.tsx`)
   - Handles errors in customer account area
   - Links back to account dashboard
   - User-friendly error messages

5. **Loading Component** (`/src/app/loading.tsx`)
   - Shows loading spinner during page transitions
   - Consistent with site theme

6. **404 Not Found Component** (`/src/app/not-found.tsx`)
   - Custom 404 page with site branding
   - Links to homepage and shop
   - Clear messaging for users

## Additional Cleanup
- Removed test and diagnostic pages that were created during CSS troubleshooting
- These pages were no longer needed and could have been causing routing issues

## Result
The error components are now in place, providing proper error boundaries and better user experience when errors occur. The application should no longer show the "missing required error components" message.

## Testing
1. The server has been restarted
2. All required error boundary components are in place
3. Test pages have been removed to prevent conflicts
4. The application should now handle errors gracefully with styled error pages
