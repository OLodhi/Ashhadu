# Website Issues Diagnostic Summary

## Current Issues:
1. **Homepage**: Shows only background colors, no content
2. **Shop Page**: No products loading (stuck in loading state)
3. **Admin Widgets**: Not loading data
4. **Account Button**: Not working (no redirect to login)

## Root Cause Analysis:

### 1. TypeScript Errors Fixed ✅
- Fixed undefined variable `featuredProducts` → `staticFeaturedProducts`
- Fixed undefined variable `existingProfile` in API route
- All TypeScript errors resolved

### 2. Server Status
- Server is running on port 3001 (not 3000)
- Environment variables are correctly set
- Database credentials are valid

### 3. Likely Issues:

#### A. Client-Side Hydration Problem
The symptoms suggest a client-side JavaScript hydration issue where:
- Server renders the initial HTML (you see background colors)
- Client-side JavaScript fails to hydrate/execute
- Components remain in their initial state (loading skeletons)

#### B. API Connectivity
- The `/api/products` endpoint should be working
- But client components may not be able to fetch from it
- Could be CORS or fetch-related issues

## Immediate Actions to Take:

1. **Check Browser Console**
   - Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
   - Look for any JavaScript errors in the Console tab
   - Check Network tab for failed API requests

2. **Test Pages Created**:
   - http://localhost:3001/test-minimal - Basic functionality test
   - http://localhost:3001/test-products - Direct database test
   - http://localhost:3001/debug - API status check

3. **Clear Cache & Rebuild**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Check for Hydration Errors**:
   Look for errors like:
   - "Hydration failed because..."
   - "Text content does not match..."
   - "Cannot read property of undefined"

## What Was Working Before:
- Products were created and exist in the database
- API routes were functional
- Authentication system was working
- Admin dashboard was showing data

## Next Steps:
1. Visit the test pages to isolate the issue
2. Check browser console for specific errors
3. The issue is likely a JavaScript execution problem, not a backend issue
