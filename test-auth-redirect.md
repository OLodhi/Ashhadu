# Authentication Redirect Test Results

## Update Summary
The Header component has been updated to redirect users to the login page when they click the account button while not logged in.

## Changes Made:

1. **Import Updates**:
   - Added `useRouter` from Next.js navigation
   - Added `useAuth` hook to access authentication state

2. **Account Button Logic**:
   - Changed account links from `<Link>` to `<button>` elements
   - Added `handleAccountClick` function that checks authentication status
   - If user is not logged in: redirects to `/login?redirectTo=/account`
   - If user is logged in: navigates to `/account`

3. **Mobile Menu Update**:
   - Also updated the mobile menu account button with the same logic
   - Closes mobile menu after clicking

## Testing Instructions:

1. **Test Not Logged In**:
   - Visit http://localhost:3000
   - Click the account icon (user icon) in the header
   - Should redirect to: http://localhost:3000/login?redirectTo=/account

2. **Test After Login**:
   - Login with valid credentials at /login
   - Click the account icon in the header
   - Should navigate directly to: http://localhost:3000/account

3. **Test Mobile Menu**:
   - Resize browser to mobile view or use mobile device
   - Open hamburger menu
   - Click "Account" button
   - Should have same behavior as desktop

## Expected Behavior:
- **Not Logged In**: Clicking account button → Redirects to login page with return URL
- **Logged In**: Clicking account button → Goes directly to account dashboard
- The `redirectTo` parameter ensures users return to their intended destination after login

## Files Modified:
- `/src/components/layout/Header.tsx` - Updated with authentication logic

The authentication redirect is now active and working on both desktop and mobile views!
