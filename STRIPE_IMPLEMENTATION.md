# Stripe Card Input Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented secure Stripe card input functionality for the checkout page, replacing the previous mock payment system with real Stripe Payment Intent processing.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Payment Intent API (`/api/stripe/create-payment-intent`)
- **Purpose**: Creates Stripe Payment Intents and generates client secrets for secure card input
- **Features**:
  - Guest and authenticated user support
  - Automatic Stripe customer creation for logged-in users
  - Proper error handling and validation
  - UK market configuration (GBP currency)

### 2. Stripe Card Form Component (`/components/checkout/StripeCardForm.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Reusable component that renders Stripe Payment Element
- **Features**:
  - PCI-compliant card input using Stripe Elements
  - Luxury design matching brand aesthetic
  - Real-time validation and error handling
  - Loading states and success indicators
  - Security notices for user confidence

### 3. Enhanced Checkout Page (`/app/checkout/page.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Integrated card input into the existing checkout flow
- **Features**:
  - Conditional rendering of Stripe form when "Card" is selected
  - Two-step process: customer info → card details
  - Proper state management for payment flow
  - Seamless integration with existing address/customer forms

### 4. Real Payment Processing (`/api/payments/process`)
- **Purpose**: Updated to handle real Stripe Payment Intent confirmation
- **Features**:
  - Verifies Payment Intent success before completing orders
  - Stores Stripe payment intent ID in database
  - Proper error handling for failed payments
  - Backward compatibility with other payment methods

### 5. Database Schema Updates
- **Added**: `stripe_customer_id` to profiles table
- **Added**: Index on `stripe_payment_intent_id` for performance
- **Purpose**: Support for Stripe customer management and payment tracking

## User Flow

### Guest Checkout with Card
1. User adds items to cart and goes to checkout
2. User enters customer information and address
3. User selects "Credit Card" as payment method
4. User clicks "Continue to Payment"
5. Stripe Payment Element loads with secure card input
6. User enters card details
7. Stripe validates and processes payment
8. Order is created and user redirected to confirmation

### Authenticated User Checkout
1. Same as guest flow, but with saved address/customer info
2. System creates/retrieves Stripe customer for future use
3. Option to save card for future purchases

## Security Features

### PCI Compliance
- Card details never touch our servers
- Stripe Elements handles all sensitive data
- Tokenization occurs client-side

### Error Handling
- User-friendly error messages
- Proper validation feedback
- Failed payment recovery options

### Data Protection
- Stripe customer IDs stored for authenticated users
- Payment intent IDs stored for order tracking
- No sensitive card data in our database

## Technical Architecture

### Client-Side
- **Stripe.js**: Official Stripe library for secure payments
- **Payment Element**: Modern, all-in-one payment form
- **React Hooks**: `useStripe()` and `useElements()` for integration

### Server-Side
- **Payment Intent API**: Creates secure payment sessions
- **Webhook Ready**: Architecture supports Stripe webhooks
- **Error Recovery**: Handles various payment failure scenarios

### Configuration
- **UK Market**: GBP currency, UK address validation
- **Luxury Design**: Gold/black theme matching brand
- **Responsive**: Works on all device sizes

```env
# Stripe Configuration (UK)
NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_...
